**Spark** is framework that can be used to solve complex Big Data problems.
**Spark** performs all the computation in Main memory that is why Spark is 100 times faster than the Hadoop in terms of computation and 10 times faster in IO operations.
**Spark** has various components for different use cases,

1. **Spark Core** - Main component of Spark (other tools bulids on top of it)
2. **Spark Streaming** - Used to process the stream of the data.
3. **Spark MLlib** - contains machine learning algorithms can be used to solve ML problems.
4. **Spark GraphX** - used to process Graph data.
